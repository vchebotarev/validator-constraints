# Symfony Validators

### OrComposite
Validation will be passed if at least one child constraint validation passed 

### KeyExists
Looks into the value if the passed key exists in it.

### AbstractConstraintList
Abstract composite constraint. Helpful to create any constraint combinations. 

### BreakOnFailure
Composite constraint. Validation by child constraints will be stopped after first error.

### AllKey
Composite constraint. Similar to All constraint, but this one validates array keys - not values.
